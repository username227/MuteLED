1. What is your laptop model?


2. How did you install MuteLED? (e.g.. AUR, package from releases, manually)


3. Which set of commands from the [wiki](https://github.com/username227/MuteLED/wiki/Get-Support-For-Your-Laptop-Model) page works for your laptop model?


4. What is the output of <code>tr -d '\0' </sys/devices/virtual/dmi/id/product_name | tr -d '\n'</code>? (this will help ensure that the model # will be read correctly)
